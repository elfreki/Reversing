On running crackme file using command

                       "./crackme"

This asks for password.

Using radare2 tool.

Step 1:Use command 
                      "r2 crackme"

Step 2:then type 
                     "aaa"   

       This will analyze all code in crackme file

Step 3:Now type 
                     "afl"  
         this will show all the functions in the code.

Step 4:type
                   "s sym.main"
  this will change the address of current position in the code to the starting point of main function.

Step 5:type 
                    "VV"
     this will show the selected function in visual mode.
     Now trying to see the function test.
Step 6:run radare2 in another terminal and follow till step 3 and then type
                    "s sys.test"

Step 7:Now type     "VV"
               this will show the test function in visual mode which has a line which is
                       
                        "cmp eax, dword [arg_ch]"
               this,shows that eax variable is being compared with another variable which is most probably the password which we type.
Now coming back to the main function

This main function has some lines of code which look like an algorithm.

            mov dword [local_8h], 0x5a                        |               
               | ; 492                                             |               
               | mov dword [local_ch], 0x1ec                       |               
               | mov edx, dword [local_ch]                         |               
               | lea eax, dword [local_8h]                         |               
               | add dword [eax], edx                              |               
               | mov eax, dword [local_8h]                         |               
               | imul eax, dword [local_8h]                        |               
               | mov dword [local_ch], eax                         |               
               | mov eax, dword [local_ch]                         |               
               | mov dword [local_4h_2], eax                       |               
               | mov eax, dword [local_4h]                         |               
               | mov dword [esp], eax    

  trying to get the algorithm
              
               let, dword [local_ch] = ch
                    dword[local_8h] = 8h
                    
so it goes like 
             mov command is like assignment operator
                8h=0x5a
                ch=0x1ec
            lea command assigns memory address to the variable
               eax->8h
             add command is used to add
             8h= 0x5a + 0x1ec= 0x246
             imul command is used to multiply
             eax=eax*8h = > eax= 0x246 * 0x246=0x52b24
             ch=0x52b24
             eax=0x52b24
             
so we got the eax=0x52b24

Step 8:Now write
               "? 0x52b24"
    in the radare2 terminal.
 
This will give the password for the question in the int32 row which is  "338724" 

Step 9:Again run the crackme file in terminal and write the password.
       This gives prompt PASSWORD OK.
